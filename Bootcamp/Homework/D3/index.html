        Analysis
    </h2>
    <br>
    The chart below shows income vs poverty level.  The red signifies those states that voted 
    Republican in the 2016 election for president.  The blue signified those states that voted
    Democrat in the last election.  The negative correlation is strong at -.78.  This chart shows that
    Democratic states tend towards the upper right quadrant and the Republican states tend toward the 
    lower left quadrant.  
    <br>
    <br>
    The desirable place to be on this chart would be towards the bottom of chart.  The blue states 
    tend towards the undesirable quadrant.
    <br>
    <br>
    The limosine liberal states and politcal/finacial centers tend to have higher poverty levels 
    given higher income levels.  Fly-over country tend to have lower levels of poverty in spite of
    the fact they have lower incomes.
